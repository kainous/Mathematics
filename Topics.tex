\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect geometry with algebra and how geometric proofs become algebraic proofs
    \item Connect functions on functions, complex numbers, linear algebra (dual numbers), exp/sin/cos, trigonometry, calculus through complex numbers and dual numbers, and topology.
    \item Introduction to Univalence and the Homotopy Type Theory (computer science, category theory, topology)
\end{itemize}
