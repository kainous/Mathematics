# Mathematics for Programmers

## Introduction via Philosophy
It may seem strange to start off a book of mathematics with philosophy, but I believe that it's necessary, in order to understand what mathematics is, what it's not, and what it's relationship is to other fields of study, such as the sciences. Furthermore, we want to know why we can consider certain things a source of knowledge and why we can trust certain things.
    
In fact, this ideas fall into the crux of philosophy -- the most important questions, which lead to the remainder of philosophy. This book is not written to necessarily traditional views, and so this discussion of the \emph{roots of philosophy} will be a source of questions that is not typically a focus had by all philosophers.

There are many branches of philosophy, and this book will focus mostly on logic. The book will contain some foundational material for mathematical and scientific inquiry, and the nature of knowledge itself. A brief introductory presentation will be given for philosophical areas of questioning, such as ethics, the nature of being, and the issues that come from poorly understood philosophical positions. Finally, many areas of questioning that philosophy addresses will be absolutely ignored by this book, due to the focus that this book has on mathematical learning.
